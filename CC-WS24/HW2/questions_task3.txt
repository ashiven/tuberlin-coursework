Question 1:
In this assignment, we configured an OpenStack environment. 
First, we activated the Python virtual environment and then imported the environment variables from the admin-openrc.sh which will be utilized by the openstack CLI. 
Through the import-images.sh and create-network.sh script, we added Ubuntu and Cirros VM images, two flavors and created internal and external networks. 
Then we set up a security group, open-all, allowing all traffic for TCP, ICMP and UDP and generated a new key pair.
After that, we created an OpenStack VM using the Ubuntu image and medium flavor on the admin network with the open-all security group. 
We assigned a floating IP to this VM and attempted to connect to it from the controller VM but encountered connectivity issues due to missing routing and NAT configuration. 
After running the iptables-magic.sh script to enable proper NAT and routing, we were able to ping the floating IP, connect via SSH, and access the internet on the VM. 
Finally, we retrieved the network_data.json file from the OpenStack metadata service.


Question 2:
The OpenStack VM was not reachable initially because the routing and NAT configuration was incomplete. Specifically:
1. The floating IP address lacked proper routing through the gateway (`br-ex`).
2. The VM's traffic wasn't masqueraded (NAT) for external communication.
3. Forwarding rules were missing to allow packets between the external interface (`ens4`) and the bridge interface (`br-ex`).

The iptables-magic.sh script resolved these issues by configuring routing and NAT.


Question 3:
docker exec openvswitch_vswitchd ip a add $floating_gateway dev br-ex
# Adds the floating gateway IP (`10.122.0.1`) to the `br-ex` interface in the `openvswitch_vswitchd` container, enabling the bridge interface to act as a gateway.
   
docker exec openvswitch_vswitchd ip link set br-ex up
# Activates the `br-ex` interface so it can route traffic.

docker exec openvswitch_vswitchd ip link set dev br-ex mtu 1400
# Adjusts the MTU to ensure SSH and other protocols work without fragmentation issues.
   
ip r a "$floating_subnet" via $floating_gateway dev br-ex
# Adds a static route to direct traffic for the floating subnet (`10.122.0.0/24`) via the floating gateway (`10.122.0.1`) on `br-ex`.
   
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ens4 -j MASQUERADE
# Configures NAT (masquerading) so that traffic leaving via the external interface (`ens4`) uses the host's external IP, allowing the VM to access the internet.
   
iptables -A FORWARD -i ens4 -o br-ex -j ACCEPT 
# Permits forwarding of packets entering `ens4` (external interface) and exiting through `br-ex`.
   
iptables -A FORWARD -i br-ex -o ens4 -j ACCEPT
# Permits forwarding of packets entering `br-ex` and exiting through `ens4`.
